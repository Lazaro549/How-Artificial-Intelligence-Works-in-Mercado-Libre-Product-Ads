# How Artificial Intelligence Works in Mercado Libre Product Ads

This repository explains in a clear and practical way how **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** works within **Mercado Libre Product Ads**, how it influences product visibility, and how sellers can leverage it to optimize their advertising campaigns.

The goal is to help sellers and eCommerce professionals understand **how the algorithm makes decisions**, **how ad positions are assigned**, and **how to optimize ad spend** while fully complying with Mercado Libre policies.

## 📌 What is Mercado Libre Product Ads?

**Product Ads** is Mercado Libre’s advertising platform that allows sellers to promote their listings within search results and product pages.

Its operation is based on:
- Cost per click (CPC)
- Automated auctions
- Listing quality evaluation
- Seller-defined objectives (ACOS)

AI is responsible for evaluating, prioritizing, and displaying the most relevant ads for each search.

## 🤖 Role of Artificial Intelligence in Product Ads

Mercado Libre’s AI analyzes multiple variables in real time, including:

- Product relevance to the search query
- Historical performance of the listing
- Conversion rate and shopping experience
- Ad quality (ad-score)
- ACOS target defined by the seller

Using this data, the system decides **which ad to show, in what position, and at what cost**.

---

## ⚙️ How does the bidding system work?

Every time a user performs a search, an **automatic auction** is triggered among eligible ads.

Ad position is determined by the **ad-rank**, which considers:
- Ad quality (ad-score)
- Target ACOS
- Competition within the auction

Mercado Libre uses the **second best price** model, meaning:
- You do not pay your maximum bid
- You only pay what is necessary to beat the closest competitor

📌 You are charged only when a user clicks on your ad.

## 📊 Key metrics analyzed by AI

Some of the most important metrics available in the Campaign Manager are:

- **Impressions**: number of times the ad was shown
- **Clicks**: number of interactions with the ad
- **Direct sales**: sales generated directly from the ad
- **Assisted sales**: sales of other products after clicking the ad
- **Revenue**: total sales attributed to ads
- **Investment**: total ad spend
- **ACOS**: advertising cost as a percentage of sales

These metrics allow the AI to continuously optimize ad delivery.

---

## 🎯 Importance of ACOS in your strategy

**ACOS (Advertising Cost of Sales)** is the core of the bidding system:

- Defines how much you are willing to spend per sale
- Determines the maximum CPC
- Directly impacts ad competitiveness

Example:
- 10% ACOS → you spend $10 for every $100 in ad-driven sales

Poor ACOS configuration can lead to:
- Low impression volume
- Reduced profitability
- Wasted advertising budget

## 🧠 AI applied to content and formats

Mercado Libre is also incorporating AI for:
- Automatic video clip creation
- Visual content optimization
- Improved buyer experience

This allows sellers to scale listings with less effort and greater impact.
